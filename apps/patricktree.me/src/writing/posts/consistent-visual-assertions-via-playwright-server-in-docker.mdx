Visual assertions (aka screenshot assertions, visual comparisons) are a high-leverage way to test UI:

- they allow to test aesthetics (e.g. colors)
- they are the only way to verify visual elements where the state of the DOM doesn't reflect what the user sees (e.g. canvas, images)
- they give a lot of bang for the buck - no fiddling with fine-grained assertions

However, visual assertions come with a major challenge: **snapshots taken in different environments often differ from each other**.

As <FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots#introduction">the Playwright Docs for Visual Comparisons</FancyAnchor> state:

> Browser rendering can vary based on the host OS, version, settings, hardware, power source (battery vs. power adapter), headless mode, and other factors.

Here is an example rendering the same content on MacOS and Ubuntu:

Popular workarounds come with major tradeoffs:

- **Updating the baseline snapshots only in one environment** (typically CI) leads to a slow feedback loop, no local debugging, and painful pull request workflows.
- **Keeping per-OS baselines** leads to extra maintenance and noisy pull request diffs.
- **Increasing pixel-diff thresholds** or **masking areas causing differences** reduces coverage in the tests and therefore, confidence.

There is, however, another option: **run Playwright browsers in a Docker container (Playwright Server).**

## The Idea: Playwright Server in Docker

Playwright ships with a <FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/docker#remote-connection">"remote connection" mode</FancyAnchor>, also called "Playwright Server".  
You can start a Playwright Server and connect to it from your Playwright tests.  
**Only the browsers run within the server**, everything else **stays on the host**.

So the setup is:

- run Playwright browsers in a Docker container (Playwright Server)
- keep the test runner on the host
- and connect the two

The result is:

- **Snapshots are consistent across development machines and CI.** All browser rendering happens in a pinned Docker image, so the rendering environment is the same everywhere.
- **Tests still run on the host.** You keep your editor, TypeScript, local tooling.  
  Fast local feedback loop without waiting for CI.
- **Minimal changes to the developer workflow.** Just ensure Docker is running.

## How to

1. Start Playwright Server in Docker with network mode `host` and a well-known port:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm --init --workdir /home/pwuser --user pwuser --network host mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble /bin/sh -c "npx -y playwright@1.57.0 run-server --port <PORT> --host 0.0.0.0"
   ```

2. Connect Playwright to the websocket endpoint of Playwright Server.

   3 options:

   - {/* prettier-ignore */}<FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-testoptions#test-options-connect-options">`connectOptions.wsEndpoint`</FancyAnchor>:

   ```typescript
   export default defineConfig({
     use: {
       connectOptions: {
         wsEndpoint: `ws://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/`,
       },
     },
   });
   ```

   - Environment variable `PW_TEST_CONNECT_WS_ENDPOINT`:

   ```bash
   PW_TEST_CONNECT_WS_ENDPOINT=ws://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/ npx playwright test
   ```

   - {/* prettier-ignore */}<FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-connect">`browserType.connect()`</FancyAnchor>:

   ```typescript
   const browser = await playwright['chromium'].connect('ws://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/');
   ```

That's it - the tests use the browsers inside the Docker container.

## Drawbacks

- {/* prettier-ignore */}<FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/debug#playwright-inspector">Playwright Inspector</FancyAnchor> (`playwright test --debug`) does not work.  
  **Workaround:** Engineers can fall back to local browsers for this. The Docker setup works for everything else, including <FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode">Playwright UI mode</FancyAnchor>.
- Running the browsers from within the Docker container is slower compared to local browsers.

## Wire it up via package.json and playwright.config.ts

You can take a look at <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/patricktree/packages/tree/main/packages/webpage-observer">`@patricktree/webpage-observer`</FancyAnchor> for a full example of wiring this up automatically.

TL;DR:

- Configure a `package.json` script to pull the Docker image (a no-op after the first run):

  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "test": "docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble && playwright test"
    }
  }
  ```

- Use the <FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver">Playwright Web Server</FancyAnchor> feature to automatically start and stop the Docker container, and extract the port chosen by the server via `wait.stdout`:

  ```typescript
  // playwright.config.ts
  export default defineConfig({
    webServer: {
      command: `docker run --rm --init --workdir /home/pwuser --user pwuser --network host mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble /bin/sh -c "npx -y playwright@1.57.0 run-server --host 0.0.0.0"`,
      wait: {
        // Capture the Playwright Server port from stdout via regex and named capture group (https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-web-server)
        stdout: /Listening on ws:\/\/0\.0\.0\.0:(?<PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER_PORT>\d+)/,
      },
      gracefulShutdown: { signal: 'SIGTERM' },
    },
  });
  ```

- Connect local Playwright to the Docker container:

  ```typescript
  // playwright.config.ts
  export default defineConfig({
    use: {
      connectOptions: {
        // Playwright automatically provides the port extracted via named capture group in `process.env`
        wsEndpoint: `ws://127.0.0.1:${process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER_PORT}/`,
      },
    },
  });
  ```

- Change snapshot naming to avoid per-OS baselines:

  ```typescript
  // playwright.config.ts
  export default defineConfig({
    snapshotPathTemplate: `{testDir}/../snapshots/{testFilePath}/{arg}-{projectName}-docker{ext}`,
  });
  ```

- If you are using Docker Desktop, make sure you have `Settings` → `Resources` → `Network` → `Enable host networking` enabled.

- Optional: add a `PWDEBUG` escape hatch so `playwright test --debug` runs with local browsers:

  ```typescript
  const playwrightWasStartedWithDebugFlag = process.env['PWDEBUG'] === '1';
  // do all steps listed above only if !playwrightWasStartedWithDebugFlag
  ```

## Summary

If you care about reliable visual regression testing, you need consistent rendering.
Running Playwright Server in Docker and connecting your tests to it gives you that consistency without sacrificing the local developer experience.

If you want to try it, skim <FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/docker#remote-connection">the Playwright docs on remote connections</FancyAnchor> and then wire it into your Playwright config as shown above.
