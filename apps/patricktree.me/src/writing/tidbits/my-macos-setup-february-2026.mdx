- Terminal Shell: **zsh**
  - with **[oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)** and the **git** plugin for branch/status info and aliases.
  - a customization in `.zshrc` to set the terminal tab title to `<idle>` so I can tell at a glance which terminals are doing something and which are not:

- Multitasking: **macOS spaces** and **<FancyAnchor href="https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/">AltTab</FancyAnchor>**
  - one macOS space (desktop) = one focus topic.
  - each space has at least one VS Code window and one browser window.
  - all windows maximized.
  - AltTab for window switching with two separate shortcuts:
    - **`Option+Tab`:** shows window thumbnails of the _current space_ only, sorted by last-recently-used.  
      Lets me quickly switch between windows related to my current focus topic.
    - **`Cmd+Tab`:** shows window thumbnails of _all spaces_, sorted by space index ascending.  
      Lets me switch to another focus topic when needed.

- IDE / Git Diff Viewer / Git Graph UI: <FancyAnchor href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">**VS Code**</FancyAnchor> with the built-in git diff views and the **<FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/hansu/vscode-git-graph">Git Graph</FancyAnchor>** extension.
- Terminal Emulator: <FancyAnchor href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics">**VS Code Integrated Terminal**</FancyAnchor> with ["Persistent Sessions"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/advanced#_persistent-sessions) enabled.
- Node.js version management: **<FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">NVM</FancyAnchor>**
- Screen capture, screenshot annotation: **<FancyAnchor href="https://cleanshot.com/">CleanShot X</FancyAnchor>**. Works great, believe me, it is worth the one-time ~$30 investment.
- **<FancyAnchor href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</FancyAnchor>** for my mesh VPN to connect my devices together. Access dev servers running on one machine from another, no port forwarding or firewall config needed - highly recommend.
- In general I use shortcuts heavily, e.g. `Cmd+Option+Left/Right` to switch between VS Code tabs or browser tabs.
